## Project Overview

I used the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  

## Project Instructions

### Necessary Python packages

- PIL
- Torch
- Torchvision
- Numpy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone git@github.com:paghasafari/Dog-Breed-Classifier.git
	```

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`.  The `dogImages/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.
3. Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 
4. Make sure you have already installed the necessary Python packages according to the README in the program repository.
5. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.
	
	```
		jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
	```
